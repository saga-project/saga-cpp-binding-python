                         SAGA C++ Python Bindings
                  - The Simple API for Grid Applications -
                 <http://saga.cct.lsu.edu/software/python> 


  WHAT IS THIS?

  These are the Python API bindings for the SAGA C++ reference 
  implementation. It provides a thin Python wrapper on top of
  the native SAGA C++ API. This allows you to use saga and all
  of its middleware adaptors with Python!
