                     - Python API Bindings UNIT TESTS -


  The unit tests require an installed version of SAGA. For informations on how 
  to install SAGA, please refer to the INSTALL file.

  Make sure you have installed the Python language bindings and that your python
  path is set properly. It should be something like this:

    export PYTHONPATH=$SAGA_LOCATION/lib/python2.5/site-packages/
  
  
  To run the unit tests, simply type:
  
    $python saga_pyhton_tests.py
    
  
  The result should look somewhat similar to this:
  
    test_file_copy (suite.packages.file.file.FilePackageTests) ... ok
    test_file_get_size (suite.packages.file.file.FilePackageTests) ... ok

  Please help us to improve the quality of SAGA and file a bug report if you 
  have encountered any problems with the unit tests. Our bug-tracking system 
  can be found at: http://saga.cct.lsu.edu/cpp/dev/
